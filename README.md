# Models-From-Scratch


This repository will show the creation of the following algorithms from scratch:

1. Linear Regression (completed)
2. Random Forest (completed)
3. Neural Networks
4. K-Nearest Neighbours


A comparison is also done with existing implementations from sklearn or other libraries and the reason for any difference is explained.
